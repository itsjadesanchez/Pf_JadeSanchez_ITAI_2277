This project develops an AI-enhanced predictive maintenance system that anticipates equipment failures before they take place. The system estimates the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines using Machine Learning and Deep Learning methodologies and identifies the risks of early failures using real sensor data from the NASA CPMAPPS dataset.
